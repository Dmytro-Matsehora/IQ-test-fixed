# IQ-test

**Demo link: [DEMO](https://dmytro-matsehora.github.io/IQ-test-fixed/)**

The project is implemented on the basis of **Vue.js**. <br/> 

- The application is a **SPA**.
- Layout is **adaptive**, works correctly on all devices.
- Ð¡ss frameworks are **not used**.
- ~~I made each test question a separate component for convenience~~
- **I added dynamics to the TestPage component, now all questions and answers are in the data array. You can easily add new questions by writing them to an array.**
- Also I followed the **BEM methodology** when naming classes for better readability and reusability.
- **Footer** text implemented using overflow.
- The call button sends a request to the **API** and shows the data in the form of a table 
  (i did data destructuring just for beauty, so as not to show everything in a row ðŸ˜Š)
